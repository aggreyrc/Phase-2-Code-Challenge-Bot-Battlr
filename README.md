# Phase 2 Code Challenge: Bot Battlr

# Introduction

This is a React project application that displays a list of available bots, among other features.

This project is designed for a galactic overload that allows them to browse through a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army.

# Features

The project has the following features;
The user is able to:

1. See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.

2. Add an individual bot to their army by clicking on it. The selected bot renders in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.

3. Release a bot from their army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the `YourBotArmy` component.

4. Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
